// The motion tokens of docs/13, read out of CSS and handed to JavaScript as
// seconds.
//
// Framework-agnostic on purpose. Motion components reach this through the
// `useTokenTransitions` wrapper in `lib/motion.ts`; GSAP components call
// `useDurationTokens` directly for a tween's `duration`. Nothing in this file
// imports Motion or GSAP, and that is what lets a GSAP-only component take the
// token contract without also taking a Motion dependency it never runs - a
// type-only import still has to resolve in the consumer's project, so keeping
// the two apart is a distribution decision, not a tidiness one.

/**
 * What a beat becomes under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * docs/04 allows **two** answers under reduce - an opacity fade of up to 200ms,
 * or final-state rendering - and which of them a component uses is a design
 * decision that belongs to the component. Before this function the token path
 * could only say one of them: a token-backed beat resolved to `0`, so
 * migrating a component that had deliberately chosen a 150ms fade silently
 * converted it to a snap. Nobody decided the snap was better; zero was just
 * the only reduce answer the vocabulary had. That is a gap in the helper, not
 * a defect in the component, and left unfixed it would have flattened every
 * remaining component with a deliberate reduce fade, one batch at a time.
 *
 * ## Why the reduce beat is a number and not a token
 *
 * Deliberately not `DurationSource`. The reduce beat is bounded by an
 * accessibility rule rather than by the design scale: its job is to avoid a
 * snap, not to carry the product's timing. A token-backed reduce beat would
 * follow a retune past docs/04's ceiling - an install setting `--dur-1: 1200ms`
 * would hand reduced-motion users a 1.2s fade - which is the one outcome the
 * rule exists to prevent. So the value is the component's own, and the ceiling
 * is enforced here rather than trusted.
 *
 * Routing every reduce beat through this function is also what keeps the
 * ratchet in `tests/motion-duration-tokens.spec.ts` honest. A bare
 * `duration: 0.15` is still a hardcoded beat and still fails the scan;
 * `reducedBeatSeconds(0.15)` is the one sanctioned way to write a reduce beat,
 * so a reader can find every one of them with a single grep.
 *
 * @param seconds The component's authored reduce beat. Omitted, zero, negative
 *   or non-finite all mean "no beat": final-state rendering, which is the
 *   default and the behaviour of every component migrated before this existed.
 * @returns Seconds, clamped to docs/04's 200ms ceiling.

/**
 * One computed CSS `<time>` as a number of seconds, or `null` if it is not one.
 *
 * Written to accept what CSS actually hands back rather than one canonical
 * spelling. A computed `transition-duration` is always `Xs`, but a custom
 * property is substitution-only: its computed value is whatever token stream
 * the consumer wrote, so `--dur-2: 210ms`, `--dur-2: 0.21s` and a value padded
 * with whitespace are all ordinary and all arrive here verbatim. A unitless
 * number is accepted as seconds, which is both CSS's rule for `0` and Motion's
 * own unit.
 *
 * A list is read at its first entry. `transition-duration` is list-valued, so a
 * consumer writing `0.2s, 0.4s` into a token gets both back; the first is the
 * one that would apply to the first transitioned property.
 *
 * Non-positive is `null` rather than `0` on purpose. Zero is what the engine
 * computes for a declaration it could not use, so honouring it would turn a
 * malformed token into a silently instant animation - the one outcome property
 * 3 above exists to prevent. A consumer who wants no motion sets
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`, which is honoured, rather than zeroing a token.

/**
 * The engine's own answer for a chain the parser above could not read.
 *
 * A custom property is substitution-only, so `--dur-2: calc(2 * 150ms)` arrives
 * as that text and any parser in this file is a partial reimplementation of CSS
 * that will keep meeting values it does not know (#455 round 11). Assigning the
 * chain to the real `transition-duration` property gives the whole job to the
 * engine, which normalises every valid `<time>` expression to `Xs` and answers
 * an invalid one with that property's initial value.
 *
 * The declaration goes onto the scope element's own inline style rather than
 * onto a probe node appended beneath it. Appending a node - even a
 * `display: none` one removed in the same synchronous block - invalidates
 * `:nth-child`, `:last-child` and `:empty` on its siblings, and the two style
 * recalculations that follow can start a real transition on a sibling that has
 * one declared. Nothing is added to the tree here, so nothing else in the
 * document can observe the read.
 *
 * On the scope element itself the read is inert too: `transition-property: none`
 * is in force for the whole of it, so no transition can start while the probe
 * declarations are applied, and neither `transition-property` nor
 * `transition-duration` is itself an animatable property, so restoring them
 * cannot start one either. Both are set `!important` so an author rule carrying
 * `!important` cannot outrank the probe. The prior inline values, priorities
 * included, are restored in a `finally`.

 * ```
 *

 *   component works; its root is the natural choice, because custom properties
 *   inherit and reading there honours an override written at `:root` **or** on
 *   any ancestor, which is what docs/13 Tier 3 rule 2 requires.
